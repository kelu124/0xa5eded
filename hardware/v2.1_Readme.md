# v2.1 : Remarks after prod

* Prod done on Nov 4th 2024
* Issues with TLV271 (particularily the GND pin)
  * Quick fix by removing TLV271 
  * and shorting pin 3 and 4 (VREF of ADC to output of U10)
* 40pins header issues:
  * Free header pins 26/17 (used in RPi by ID EEPROM)
  * Wrong GND pin: move GND from pin 22 to pin 20 (22 isn't ground)
