# v2.1 : Remarks after prod

## Issues

Prod done on Nov 4th 2024

* Issues with TLV271 (particularily the GND pin)
  * Quick fix by removing TLV271 
  * and shorting pin 3 and 4 (VREF of ADC to output of U10)

* 40pins header issues:
  * Free header pins 26/17 (used in RPi by ID EEPROM), move to other pins
  * Wrong GND pin: move GND from pin 22 to pin 20 (22 isn't ground)
  * Rename GPIO24/GPIO25 on schematics (to the 2 other ADCs)
  * A0 to be to header too

* SDA and SCL are switched. Needs to be corrected.
* Add pullups to the SDA lines, to 3.3V.

## Passive sizes

* Make R16, R8 and R9 1206-sized
